Finish Css for all pagesssss --- KeSha - fonts - blue -> green - pastel pink --> spun cotton white - styling - mater (maybe add a line that says the date with the day of the week under Hi name welcome...?)

set a max # of todos ? ------- Olivia - container - flex - relative to container

Javascript -
when submitting with empty fields it keeps loading ---Olivia
-fix by adding alert - form validation for completing

dragging and refreshing ---- Olivia - keep data to dragged column.

checkbox to move tasks into diff columns --- KeSha - copy and hide in todo

but really who... show yourself.

future ideas:

- opensource
- attach to 100devs
- kanboard for each class

Psuedo Code:
request thru - moving task from todo to in progress
-hit controller - to handle put request - update

- go to model to update item in database to in progress - boolean
  respond back to controller with updated status
  -controller hits our views - render with response that task is in progress

inprogress = todoItemapend('#ul2')
completed = todoItemappend('#ul3')

if (todoItem === inprogress){
do this function
}else ( completed)
then strike through when clicked
